# library
A library web page which allows users to add books that they have read or haven't read.

## Design
In this project I used six primary colours, which I had defined in the :root pseudo class of my stylesheet.

Black Jungle Green colour: #0D160B
French Lilac colour: #785589
Old Rose colour: #AC7B7D
Black Coffee colour: #2A1A1F
Blood Red colour: #880808
Dark Green colour: #003D00

I didn't pick one layout system and sticked to it. I used Grid Layout when it made sense and I used Flexbox when it made sense.

## Capabilities
The web page doesn't currently support local or cloud storage. This means that reloading the page will destroy everything that user has entered.

## Skills
- Semantic HTML.
- The use of CSS custom properties.
- Grid and Flexbox layout systems.
- Creation of interactive forms.
- Basic form validation.
- Object constructors.
- Prototypes.
